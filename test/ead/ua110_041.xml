            <abstract id="ref2" label="Abstract">The Historic Architecture Research Project Records contain drawings and project files by students in the Department of Architecture, School of Design, at North Carolina State University. Included are measured drawings, photographs, negatives, field notes and sketches, historical information, and essays. The majority of the projects document historic buildings in North Carolina. Twenty-one other states and the District of Columbia are represented, as are Germany, Mexico, and Colombia. Other course-related materials include syllabi, correspondence, uncompleted projects, and a petition to eliminate the course requirement. The correspondence series includes correspondence of professors in the North Carolina State University Department of Architecture, including Cecil D. Elliott, Henry L. Kamphoefner, Vernon Shogren, and Lawrence Wodehouse, with North Carolina State University architecture students, various North Carolina clerks of court, Charles E. Peterson of the National Park Service, and George S. Koyl, Moira B. Mathieson, and Earl H. Reed of the American Institute of Architects.</abstract>
            <abstract id="ref3" label="Abstract">Between 1951 and 1969, many architecture students at North Carolina State University completed summer projects documenting historic buildings and districts. Beginning in 1959, these projects were submitted to the National Park Service's Historic American Buildings Survey. The project was formalized with the creation of the undergraduate course, "Historic Architecture Research" (ARC 300), which was required for admission to the fifth year architecture program. In 1964, students undertook a project to record the town of Beaufort in Carteret County, N.C. Participants created maps, measured drawings of buildings, and an historical analysis of the town's development.</abstract>

                    <p>The Historic Architecture Research Project Records projects series includes architectural drawings, project notes, photographs, and historical information about subject buildings. Drawings are included for most, but not all, projects. Approximately one-third of the projects include one or more photographs, most of which are in sleeves, though some are mounted on mat board or paper. Most photos are black and white; some sepia and color prints are included as well. Photo sizes vary, ranging from 2" x 2" to 8" x 10".</p>
                    <p>Materials are filed by project number. For most projects, there are a flat folder containing oversized drawings and one or two letter-sized folders containing other material, such as field notes, photographs, or smaller drawings.</p>

                    <p>The Historic Architecture Research Project Records photographs series includes approximately 2,000 black and white photographs of historic buildings across North Carolina, circa 1950s. Most photos are approximately 3"x 5"; some are 3"x 3" with some of the smaller photos mounted on index cards. Photos were originally stored in a card catalog, and all have a small hole punched in the middle near the bottom edge. They are organized alphabetically by county and accompanied by index cards listing name and location information. Most photo subjects are houses, though some other buildings (such as churches, schools, and offices) are represented.</p>
