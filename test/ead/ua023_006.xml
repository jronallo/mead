            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>As a land-grant institution, North Carolina State University has had agricultural study as an integral part of instruction since its beginning in 1887. In 1917, the first dean of agriculture took office, and the School of Agriculture was established in 1923. The name was changed to School of Agriculture and Life Sciences in 1964, and finally to College of Agriculture and Life Sciences in 1987.</p>
            <p>The earliest courses of at NCSU were only in agriculture and mechanics, with classes in the former category consisting of "general agriculture, horticulture, arboriculture, and botany." Gradually, as the curriculum expanded, sets of classes were organized into "faculties" and then departments. Professors named to head these faculties or departments were usually given titles according to their specialty, such as Arborist or Agronomist. Additionally, experimental and practical work at the North Carolina Experiment Station and the Extension Service was increasingly undertaken by State College personnel.</p>
            <p>With the reorganization of campus and academic administration came a shuffling of the curriculum within the new Agricultural School. Programs, or "instructional areas" were reduced to six: Agronomy, Animal Industry, Botany, Horticulture, Poultry Science, and Zoology. At the same time, work at the Experiment Station and in the Extension Service was more fully integrated into these programs, and cooperation among the three branches of the School took off. This situation remained largely unchanged until the creation of a Forestry program in 1929, which eventually became the Division of Forestry in 1931. This name change resulted in another one, when in 1932 the School of Agriculture became the School of Agriculture and Forestry.</p>
            <p>New programs were added through the 1930s and 1940s, but the organization of the School remained largely unchanged. Several changes occurred in 1950, however. The Division of Forestry was split from Agriculture, to become the new School of Forestry, with Agriculture reverting to its old designation, the School of Agriculture. The other change was the creation that same year of the Division of Biological Sciences, combining the Faculties of Botany, Entomology, Plant Pathology, and Zoology, adding Genetics in 1951. This set-up continued until 1958, when the Division was disbanded and its constituent parts granted Department status as individual units within the School of Agriculture. The 1950s also saw dramatic increases in budgets for research and teaching, and the first international effort for the School, the Peru Project, which started in 1955.</p>
            <p>The 1960s brought another decade of change to the School, not least of which was another name change in 1964, becoming the School of Agriculture and Life Sciences. One prompt for the new name was an increase in the importance and development of the biological sciences, prompting the creation of the Institute of Biological Sciences in 1962, which in large part succeeded the disbanded Division of Biological Sciences. The Agricultural Policy Institute was created in 1960 in conjunction with the Kellogg Foundation, and worked with agricultural institutions across the south to address and mold public policy issues regarding southern agriculture.</p>
            <p>The recent decades have seen steady growth in physical space, students, research, and funding. In 1987, a final name change occurred, and the School of Agriculture and Life Sciences became the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. In 2006 the Department of Botany was renamed the Department of Plant Biology. As of 2009, the College consists of 22 academic and extension departments, and runs the North Carolina Agricultural Research Service, the current name of the former Agricultural Experiment Station. The College continues to strive to meet its three primary functions -- teaching, research, and extension -- as first laid out over a century ago.</p>
